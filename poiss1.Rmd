## Generalizations of the Poisson Process


### Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process

**Definition**

A counting process {N(t);t≥0} is said to be a nonhomogeneous Poisson
process with intensity function λ(t), t &gt;0 if  
  
1) N(0)=0  
2) N(t) has independent increments  
3) P(N(t+h)-N(t)=1) = λ(t)h + o(h)  
4) P(N(t+h)-N(t)≥2) = o(h)

Using induction it is then easy to show that

#### **Example** 

say you run a hot dog stand that opens at 8am. From 8am to
11am customers arrive, on average, at a steadily increasing rate of that
starts at 5 customers per hour and reaches 20 at 11am. From 11am to 1 pm
that average rate is constant at 20 customers per hour. Finally from 1pm
to 5pm the rate drops steadily from 20 to 12. If we assume that arrivals
are independent, we have a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with  
![](graphs/genpoiss3.png)

and λ(t)=λ(t-9) for t&gt;9 (the next day)

What is the probability that now customers arrive between 8:30am and
9:30am?

The number of arrivals between 8:30am and 9:30am has a Poisson
distribution with rate m(3/2)-m(1/2)  
![](graphs/genpoiss4.png)  
What is the expected number of customers between 8:30am and 9:30am?

It is m(3/2)-m(1/2) = 10

### Compound Poisson Processes

Say {N(t),t&gt;0} is a Poisson process, and {Y~i~,i≥t} is a
family of iid rv's, independent also of N(t). Let  
![](graphs/genpoiss5.png)  
then X(t) is called a compound Poisson process.

#### **Example**

1) say Y~i~=1, then X is a regular Poisson process

2) Suppose buses arrive at an event in accordance with a Poisson
process, and suppose the number of people on each bus is are iid. Say
X(t) is the total number of people who arrived at time t, the {X(t)} is
a compound Poisson process

3) Suppose customers leave a supermarket in accordance to some Poisson
process. If Y~i~ is the amount spent by customer i, and if the
Y~i~'s are iid then {X(t),t≥0} , the total spent up to time t,
is a compound Poisson process.

### Marked Poisson

  
#### **Example** 

say people arrive at an ATM machine at times given by a
Poisson process with rate λ. At the machine they either deposit or
withdraw money. The amount of money deposited or withdrawn by the
i^th^ person is given by a rv Y~i~, and we can assume
the Y~i~'s are independent. Say at 8am the machine is refilled
with money. How much does it have to have so with a probability of 0.99
it still has money at 4pm, when it is scheduled to be filled again?

Let W~i~ be the waiting time until the i^th^ event in
the Poisson process, then the sequence (W~i~,Y~i~) is
called a marked Poisson process.

Let's begin the analysis with a very simple version:
Y~i~~Ber(p). Let X~1~(t) be the process that considers
only the times when Y~i~=1 and X~0~(t)
correspondingly. Then  
![](graphs/genpoiss8.png)  
Next we need to following

**Theorem** let N be a Poisson rv with rate λ. Conditional on N let X
have a binomial distribution with parameters N and p. Then the
unconditional distribution of X is Poisson with rate λp  
  
proof:  
![](graphs/genpoiss9.png)  
Now back to our process X~1~. By its definition it has
independent and stationary increments, X~1~(0)=0 and by the
theorem above X~1~(t) ~ Pois(λpt). Therefore
{X~1~(t),t≥0} is a Poisson process rate λp. Obviously also
{X~0~(t),t≥0} is a Poisson process rate λq. The surprising part
is the following:

First note that X~1~(t)|N(t)=n ~ Bin(n,p)

![](graphs/genpoiss10.png)  
and now we find  
![](graphs/genpoiss11.png)  
and so we see that X~1~(t) and X~0~(t) are
independent!

#### **Example** 

Customers arrive at a store according to a Poisson process
with rate of 2 per hour. Each customer is a "Buyer" with probability 0.3
or a "Window-Shopper" with probability q=0.7. What is the probability of
at least 1 sale during a 2 hour period?

P(at least 1 sales) = P(N~1~(t)≥1) = 1-P(N~1~(t)=0) =
1-exp(-2\*2\*0.3) = 1-e^-1.2^ =0.7

What is the probability that we have made a sale if by time t there
where k customers in the store?

![](graphs/poiss23.png)

Let's say the Y~i~'s are discrete rv's which take values 0, 1,
.. with P(Y~i~=k)=a~k~

Now a straightforward extension of the calculations above shows that
(X~k~(t),t≥0} is Poisson process with rate λa~k~

#### **Example** 

In our ATM problem let's assume that a customer withdraws or
deposits money as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tbl <- source("tables/poiss1.R")[[1]]
kable.nice(tbl[[1]], do.row.names = FALSE)
```



#### **Example** (Coupon Collection Problem) 

There are m different coupons.
Each time a person collects a coupon it is, independently of those
previously obtained, of type j with probability p~j~. Let N
denote the number of coupons one needs in order to have a complete
collection of at least one of each type. Find E[N]

Let N~j~ be the number of coupons needed until we have one of
type j, then N=max~1≤j≤m~ N~j~ . It is easy to see
that N~j~~Geom(p~j~), but they are not independent and
so finding the distribution of their maximum is very difficult

Let's assume that that coupons are collected according to a Poisson
process with rate 1, and say an event is of type j if the coupon
collected was of type j. If we let N~j~(t) denote the number of
type j coupons collected by time t, then it follows that
{N~j~(t),t≥0} are independent Poisson processes with rates
p~j~. Let X~j~ denote the time of the first event of
type j, and let X=max~1≤j≤m~X~j~ be the time when we
have all the coupons. Now the X~j~ are the waiting times of
independent Poisson processes, so they have an exponential distributions
and are independent, so  
![](graphs/poiss15.png)  
Now let T~i~ be the i^th^ interarrival time, that is
the time between finding the (i-1)^st^ and the i^th^
coupon. the X=∑T~i~, but T~i~~Exp(1), and they are
independent, so E[X|N]=E[∑T~i~|N]=NE[T~1~|N]=N,
so

E[X]=E{E[X|N]}=E[N]

For example, say p~1~=..=p~n~=p=1/m, then

![](graphs/poiss16.png)  
```{r echo=FALSE}
kable.nice(tbl[[2]], do.row.names = FALSE)
```


What if m-1 have the same probability, but one is rarer, say only half
of the probability of the others? So (wlog)
2p~1~==p~2~=..=p~m~=1, then
p~i~=1/(m-1/2) for i≤2≤m and p~1~=1/[2(m-1/2)]

![](graphs/poiss17.png)  
this integral has to be found numerically, using some numerical
integration method. Then we get

```{r echo=FALSE}
tbl <- source("tables/poiss1.R")[[1]]
kable.nice(tbl[[3]], do.row.names = FALSE)
```


**Proposition**

If {N~i~(t);t≥0} i=1,..,k represent the number
of type i events occurring in (0,t] and if P~i~(t) is the
probability that an event occurring at time t is of type i, then  
![](graphs/poiss18.png)  

#### **Example** (HIV-Aids) 

one of the difficulties in tracking the number
of HIV infected people is its long incubation time, that is an infected
person does not show any symptoms for a number of years, but is capable
of infecting others.  
Let us suppose that individuals contract HIV according to a Poisson
process with unknown rate λ. Suppose that the incubation time until
symptoms appear is a rv with cdf G, which is known, and suppose
incubation times are independent. Let N~1~(t) be the number of
individuals that have shown symptoms at time t, and let N~2~(t)
be the number that have contracted HIV at time t but not yet shown
symptoms. An individual that contracts HIV at time s will show symptoms
at time t with probability G(t-s), so it follows from the above
proposition that  
![](graphs/poiss19.png)  
say we know the number of individuals with system as time t is
n~1~, then  
![](graphs/poiss20.png)  
for example if t=16 years, μ=10 years and n~1~=220,000, then
n~2~=219,00
