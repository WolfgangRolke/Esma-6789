## Stochastic Processes


Any collection of random vectors {**X**~t~,t∈T} is called a
**stochastic process**. All the values that the random variables
X~t~ can take on are called the **state space**. Because
X~t~ is a regular random variable (or vector) we again
differentiate between continuous and discrete state space cases.
Moreover T can be discrete (1,2,..) or continuous (t&gt;0) as well.

#### **Example** 

Let X~i~~U[0,1], i=1,2,.. X~i~
independent of X~j~, then {X~i~, i=1,2,..} is a
continuous state space discrete time process.

#### **Example** 

Let X~i~∈{0,..,39} the position on the board of
your token after i roles of the dice in a game of Monopoly. Then
{X~i~, i=1,2,..} is a discrete state space discrete time
process.

#### **Example** 

Let P(Z~i~=-1)=p=1-P(Z~i~=1),
Z~i~ independent from Z~j~ if i≠j. Let  
![](graphs/stoch1.png)  
then X~n~∈{0,±1,±2,..} and so {X~n~, n=1,2,..} is a
discrete state space discrete time process. This is a very famous
stochastic process called a random walk.  
  
Here is a list of things we often want to know about a stochastic
process:

• what is the distribution of X~n~, especially in the limit?

• what is EX~n~, especially in the limit?

• what is cor(X~n~,X~n+k~)?
