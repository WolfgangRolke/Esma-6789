## Random Variables


**Definition**

A **random variable** (r.v.) X is set-valued function from the sample
space into $\mathbb{R}$. For any set of real numbers
A$\subset \mathbb{R}$ we define the probability
P(X$\in$ A) = P(X^-1^(A)), where
X^-1^(A) is the set of all points in S such that X maps the
points into A.

#### **Example** 

Say we flip a fair coin three times. Let X be the number of
"heads" in these three flips.  
  
Now S=({H,H,H}, (H,H,T), .., (T,T,T)}.

X maps S into $\mathbb{R}$, for example X((H,H,H))=3 and
X((H,H,T))=2.

What is P(X=2)?

P(X=2) = P(X^-1^(2)) = P( all the outcomes in S that are mapped
onto 2 ) = P({(H,H,T), (H,T,H), (T,H,H)} = 3/8

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some technical difficulties when defining a r.v. on a sample
space like $\mathbb{R}$, it turns out to be impossible to define it
for every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ without getting logical
contradictions. In some (mathematically precise) sense there are too
many subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. The solution is to define a
**σ-algebra** on the sample space and then define X only on that
σ-algebra. We will ignore these technical difficulties.

There are two basic types of r.v.'s:

**Definition**

If X takes countably many values, X is called a **discrete** r.v.  
  
If X takes uncountably many values, X is called a **continuous** r.v.

Almost everything to do with r.v.'s has to be done twice, once for
discrete and once for continuous r.v.'s. This separation is only
artificial, it goes away once a more general definition of "integral" is
used (Riemann-Stilties or Lebesgue)

### (Commulative) Distribution Function


**Definition**

The (cumulative) distribution function of a r.v. X (or cdf) is defined
by F(x) = P(X≤x) $\forall$  x $\in$ 
$\mathbb{R}$

#### **Example** 

Say we roll a fair die until the first "Six" comes up. Let X
be the number of rolls needed.  
  
First note X$\in$ {1,2,...}  
  
let A~i~ be the event "a six on the i^th^ roll",
i=1,2,3, .... Then  
![](graphs/prob12.png)

  
so for k≤x&lt;k+1 we have F(x)=1-(5/6)^k^  
<img src="graphs/prob13.png" width="500" height="500" />

**Proposition**

Let F be the cdf of a rv X.

Then

1) 0≤F(x)≤1
$\forall$ x$\in \mathbb{R}$  
  
2) F is non-decreasing  
  
3) F is right-continuous  
  
4) F(x)→0 as x→-∞ and F(x)→1 as x→∞

**Theorem**

Say F is a function with properties 1-4. Then there exists a random
variable X which has F as its distribution function.

**proof** VERY DEEP, based on Kolmogorov's extension theorem

### Probability Density Functions

**Definition**

1) The probability density function (density, pdf) of a discrete r.v. X is defined
by 

$f(x) = P(X=x)$ $\forall  x \in \mathbb{R}$  
  
2) The density  f of a continuous random
variable X is defined by

$f(x) = F'(x)$

where the derivative exists  

#### **Example**: 

Say we roll a fair die until the first "Six" comes up. Let
X be the number of rolls needed. Then the density of X is given by

f(x) = P(X=x) = 1/6\*(5/6)^x-1^ if
x$\in$ {1,2,..}, 0 otherwise.

Note that it follows from the definition and the axioms that for any density
f we have  
![](graphs/prob16.png)

  
#### **Example** (First "Six"):  
f(x) = P(X=x) = 0 if x$\not\in$ {1, 2, ..}  
f(x) = P(X=x) = 1/6\*(5/6)^x-1^ $\in$  [0,1] if
x$\not\in$ {1, 2, ..}  
  
![](graphs/prob17.png)

Let X be a continuous rv, then again it follows from the definition and
the axioms that for any pdf f we have  
![](graphs/prob18.png)

#### **Example** 

Let X be a continuous rv with density f(x)=λexp(-λx) if
x&gt;0, 0 otherwise, where λ&gt;0  
clearly f(x)≥0 for all x.  
![](graphs/prob19.png)  
This r.v. X is called an exponential r.v. with rate λ. We use the
notation X~Exp(λ)

#### **Example** 

Let X be a continuous rv with density f(x)=cx^λ^ if
x&gt;1, 0 otherwise, where c is a constant (which depends on λ). For
which values of λ is this a density, and what is c?  
![](graphs/prob120.png)  
so it is is a density if λ&lt;-1, and then c=-(1+ λ)

### Random Vectors

A random vector is a multi-dimensional random variable.

#### **Example**:

we roll a fair die twice. Let X be the sum of the rolls and
let Y be the absolute difference between the two roles. Then (X,Y) is a
2-dimensional random vector. The joint density of (X,Y) is given by:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tbl <- source("tables/probability1.R")[[1]][[1]]
colnames(tbl) <- c("X.Y", paste0(0:5," "))
kable.nice(tbl, do.row.names = FALSE)
```


  
where every number is divided by 36.

all definitions are straightforward extensions of the one-dimensional
case.

#### **Example**: 

for a discrete random vector we have the density

f(x,y) = P(X=x,Y=y)  
  
f(4,0) = P(X=4, Y=0) = P({(2,2)}) = 1/36

or

f(7,1) = P(X=7,Y=1) = P({(3,4),(4,3)}) = 1/18

### Marginal Densities

**Definition**

Say (X,Y) is a discrete (continuous) r.v. with joint density (pdf) f. Then
the **marginal** density (pdf) f~X~ is given by  
![](graphs/prob110.png)

#### **Example** 

For the example above we find f~X~(2) = f(2,0) +
f(2,1) + .. + f(2,5) = 1/36 or f~Y~(3) = 6/36

#### **Example** 

Let (X,Y) be a continuous random vector with joint pdf
f(x,y) = cx, 0≤x&lt;y≤1, 0 otherwise. Now  
![](graphs/prob111.png)  
Next we find the marginals of f:  
![](graphs/prob112.png)  
Note that the marginals are proper densities, for example
f~X~(x)≥0 and  
![](graphs/prob113.png)

### Conditional Densities

**Definition**

Let (X,Y) be a r.v. with joint density (pdf) f(x,y). For any x such that
f~X~(x)&gt;0 we can define the conditional rv Y|X=x.

If (X,Y) is discrete we find  
  
P(Y=y|X=x) = P(Y=y,X=x)/P(X=x)  
  
so the density of Y|X=x, denoted by f~Y|X=x~(y|x) is given by  
![](graphs/prob114.png)  
If (X,Y) are continuous the derivation is a little harder but the same
formula holds.

#### **Example** 

say (X,Y) is a discrete rv with f(x,y)=cα^-xy^
where α&gt;1, x,y=1,2,3.. Find the conditional density's and check that they
are proper density's  
![](graphs/prob132.png)  
but this is the density of a geometric rv with p=α^-x^. Moreover
the pdf f(x,y) is symmetric in x and y, so the same calculation gives

f~X|Y=y~(x|y)

Note that in this calculation we did not have to find the constant c! At
least not if we don't need to know the marginal of X.

#### **Example**

for the continuous rv. above find f~X|Y=y~(x|y) and
f~Y|X=x~(y|x)  
![](graphs/prob116.png)  
Conditional density's and pdf's are again proper density's and pdf's, for
example  
  
f~X|Y=y~(x|y) = 2x/y^2^ ≥0 for 0&lt;x&lt;y and  
![](graphs/prob117.png)

Note that a conditional density (pdf) requires a specification for a value
of the random variable on which we condition, something like
f~X|Y=y~ for a fixed y. An expression like f~X|Y~ is
not defined!

#### **Example**

say the rv (X,Y) has joint density f(x,y)=c if
0&lt;x&lt;y^p^&lt;1, 0 otherwise, for some p&gt;0. Find the
conditional density of X|Y=y  
![](graphs/prob131.png)  

### Independence

**Definition**

Two r.v. X and Y are said to be independent iff

f~X,Y~(x,y)=f~X~(x)\*f~Y~(y) for all x,y

We write this here as a definition but it it actually follows
straightforward from the definition of independence of events.

#### **Example**

in the discrete example above we found f(7,1) = 1/18 but
f~X~(7)\*f~Y~(1) = 1/6\*10/36=5/108, so X and Y are
not independent

#### **Example** 

For the continuous example we have  
  
6x = f(x,y) ≠ 6x(1-x)×3y^2^ =
f~X~(x)\*f~Y~(y)  
  
so X and Y are not independent

Mostly the concept of independence is used in reverse: we assume X and Y
are independent (based on good reason!) and then make use of the
formula:

#### **Example**

Say it is known that the lifetime of a light bulb has an
exponential distribution with rate λ=1/500 days. We have 2 such
light bulbs in a lamp. What is the probability that at least one flashbulb
is still burning after 3 years?

Let the rv (X,Y) be the lifetimes of the 2 light bulbs. Then if the
lifetimes are independent the joint density is given by  
![](graphs/prob118.png)

Now  
![](graphs/prob119.png)

  
By the way, do you think the assumption of independence is actually
justified here?

Notation: we will use the notation X $\perp$ Y if X and Y
are independent
