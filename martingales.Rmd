# Other Stochastic Processes
 
## Martingales

A *martingale* is a stochastic process that formalizes the idea of a
fair game.

**Definition**

A stochastic process {Z~n~,n≥1} is said to be a *martingale*
process if

E[|Z~n~|]&lt;∞ for all n  
  
and  
  
E[Z~n+1~|Z~1~,..,Z~n~]=Z~n~  

so if we think of Z~n~ as the fortune of a gambler than for a
martingale process the expected fortune stays constant. Note

E[Z~n+1~]=E{E[Z~n+1~|Z~1~,..,Z~n~]}=E[Z~n~]=..=E[Z~1~]

#### **Example** 

let X~1~, X~2~,.. be independent rv's with
mean 0 and let Z~n~=X~1~+..+X~n~, then

#### **Example**

let X~1~, X~2~,.. be independent rv's with
mean 1 and let Z~n~=X~1~×..×X~n~, then  
  
![](graphs/mart2.png)

#### **Example**

Let $\{N(t); t\ge0\}$ be a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, then $X(t)=N(t)-\lambda t$ is a (continuous-time) martingale.

The fact that the expectation only depends on the last time point before t follows from the fact that a Poisson process is a Markov process. Now

$$
\begin{aligned}
&E[X(t)|X(s)] = \\
&E[N(t)-\lambda t| N(s)-\lambda s] =\\
&E[N(t)-\lambda t| N(s)] =\\
&E[N(t)-N(s)+N(s)-\lambda t| N(s)] =\\
&E[N(t)-N(s)| N(s)] + E[N(s)-\lambda t| N(s)] =\\
&E[N(t)-N(s)] + N(s)-\lambda t =\\
&\lambda(t-s) + N(s)-\lambda t =\\
&N(s)-\lambda s=X(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

The more impressive result is the reverse: this is the only counting process that is a martingale! (Watanabe 1964)

**Definition** 

A positive integer-valued, possibly infinite, rv N is
said to be a *random time* for the process {Z~n~,n≥1} if the
event {N=n} is determined by the random variables
Z~1~,..,Z~n~. That is, knowing
Z~1~,..,Z~n~ tells us whether or not N=n. If
P(N&lt;∞}=1, then N is called a *stopping time*

#### **Example** 

say a player plays roulette. He starts with $100 and bets
$1 in each round. He decides to stop if he reaches $200 (or goes broke).
Then if N is the number of games he plays N is stopping time.

**Definition** 

Let N be a random time for the process
{Z~n~,n≥1}, then  
![](graphs/mart3.png)  
is called the stopped process.

**Proposition**  

If N is a random time for the martingale {Z~n~,n≥1}, then the
stopped process is also a martingale.  
without proof

Here is the main result for martingales:

**Theorem (The Martingale Stopping Theorem}**  

If either

(i) the stopped process is uniformly bounded  
(ii) N is bounded, or  
(ii) E[N]&lt;∞

and there is an M&lt;∞ such that

E[|Z~n+1~-Z~n~|
|Z~1~,..,Z~n~]&lt;M

then E[Z~n~]=E[Z~1~]

In other words in a fair game if a gambler uses a stopping time to
decide when to quit, then his expected final fortune is equal to his
expected initial fortune. Thus in the sense of expected value, no
successful gambling strategy is possible if one of the conditions of the
theorem are satisfied.

#### **Example** 

There are many supposedly "guaranteed" strategies on how to
win in a casino. A popular one is this: bet $1 on red in roulette. if
you loose double your bet and so on. Say you loose 3 times and then win,
then your net-win is -1+(-2)+(-4)+8=+1, so you win $1. In fact a
"sequence" of n losses followed by a win always ends with an overall win
of $1! Great! Unfortunately according to the martingale stopping
theorem, even if roulette were a fair game this would still not work!
Why not?  
By the way, strategies of this type have a name, the St. Petersburg
strategy.

**Corollary (Wald's equation)** 

If X~i~, i≥1 are iid with
E[|X|]&lt;∞ and if N is a stopping time for X~1~,
X~2~,.. with E[N]&lt;∞, then

#### **Example** 

suppose a computer randomly generates integers. Let N be the
number of integers it has to generate before we see a predetermined
sequence, for example (0 0 0 0) or maybe (0 1 2 3 4 5).  
  
To compute E[N] imagine a sequence of gambles, each initially having 1
unit, playing a fair game. Gambler i begins playing at the beginning of
the i^th^ day bets 1 unit that the value on that day is equal
to 0. If he wins (and so has 10 units) he bets those 10 units on the
second day, again to get 0. If he wins again he will have 100 units and
so on. If 0 0 0 0 happens he wins $10000-$1 = $9999, if any of his bets
fails he looses $1. At the beginning of each day another gambler starts
to play. If we let X~n~ denote the total wining of the casino
after the n^th^ day, then since all bets are fair X~n~
is a martingale with mean 0. Let N denote the time until 0 0 0 0
happens. Now at the end of day N each of the gamblers 1,..,N-4 would
have lost 41, gambler N-3 would have won $9999, gambler N-2 would have
won $999, gambler N-1 $99 and gambler N $9. So

X~N~=N-4-$9999-$999-$99-$9=N-11110=0, so E[N]=11110
